SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
- It's done WHEN I add my database name, PostgreSQL username, and PostgreSQL password to an environment variable file, THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize

- It's done WHEN I enter schema and seed commands, THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data.

- It's done WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application, THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the PostgreSQL database

- It's done WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags, THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

- It's done WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.
